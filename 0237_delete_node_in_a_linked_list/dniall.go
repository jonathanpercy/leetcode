https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Note:
The linked list will have at least two elements.
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
Do not return anything from your function.
